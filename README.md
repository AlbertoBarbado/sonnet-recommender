# SAREK -  Sonnet Recommender System

This is the project for **SAREK (Sonnet Affective Recommender with Embedding Knowledge)** virtual assistant. He can recommend you a spanish sonnet from the last 5 centuries according to an input query.

For the embeddings the system uses BERT (https://github.com/google-research/bert) and composes the word embedding for individual words for each stanza of the sonnet using different composition funcions (sum and RL-SEQ joint)

He will also ask you some questions about your experience working with the app and about your valence and arousal states.
